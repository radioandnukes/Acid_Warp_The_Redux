# Acid Warp GL — Chaos Edition

> *"Because 1992 called. It wants its trippy screen savers back."*

Welcome to **Acid Warp GL**, a modern reimagining of the legendary `acidwarp.exe` from the MS-DOS era — but with more chaos, RGB abuse, and GLSL shader wizardry than your Packard Bell could ever dream of.  

This Python + OpenGL port brings back the nostalgia of late-night CRT visuals, VGA palette cycling, and that time you almost fried your eyeballs staring at plasma tunnels while listening to Aphex Twin on Winamp.  
Now upgraded for 2025, running on GPUs that can draw a billion triangles while you blink.

## Features

- **Six Classic Warp Modes**:  
  - Plasma (OG `acidwarp` vibes)  
  - Rings (because concentric circles are eternal)  
  - Swirl (cue the “falling into the void” feeling)  
  - XOR Candy (8-bit fever dream)  
  - Tunnel (hello, screensaver wormholes)  
  - Mandel-ish (psychedelic math trip)  

- **Five Palettes**: Rainbow, Fire, Ice, Slime, and Grayscale (for when you want your acid warp to look like an existential art film).

- **Chaos Mode™**: 
  - Auto-roll palettes like it’s 1995 and your Sound Blaster is blasting.
  - Random RGB gain (aka “why is my screen pink now?”)
  - Random effect + palette cycling (perfect for LAN parties or scaring your cat).
  - Full **toggle-everything-at-once** panic button.

- **Glorious Modern OpenGL**:
  - Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux (if you’ve got GLFW + PyOpenGL installed).  
  - Uses shaders, because fixed-function pipelines are for boomers.

## Controls (a.k.a. The Warp Board)

- `1–6` — Switch effects manually.  
- `← / →` — Next/previous effect.  
- `↑ / ↓` — Speed up / slow down warp time.  
- `A / Z` — Cycle palettes forward / backward.  
- `[ / ]` — Manual palette shift (like the old VGA trick).  
- `SPACE` — Pause time (for when you need to take in the beauty).  
- `R` — Auto-roll palette shift toggle.  
- `C` — Random RGB chaos toggle.  
- `P` — Random palette toggle.  
- `E` — Random effect toggle.  
- `T` — Toggle ALL chaos modes at once (press this when you want the full “acid.exe at 3 AM” experience).  
- `9 / 0` — Adjust auto-roll speed.

- `ESC` — Exit (but why would you ever want to?).

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install glfw PyOpenGL
    ```
2. Run it:
    ```bash
    python acid_warp_gl.py
    ```

Make sure you have a GPU capable of OpenGL 3.3 or higher. If you’re running this on a 486 with a Trident VGA card… uh, good luck.

## Nostalgia Trip

For the uninitiated:  
`acidwarp.exe` was a 90s DOS screensaver that displayed plasma-like patterns with wild VGA palette cycling. It was often installed on sketchy shareware CDs between Doom WADs and *Duke Nukem 3D* maps.

This project is that — but louder, brighter, and much more GPU-abusive.  
Now you can relive your **acid warp childhood** while questioning why the 90s thought cycling rainbows on a 14" CRT was the pinnacle of computing.
